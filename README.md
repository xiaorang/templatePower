use Tags to make document
There are some template doc tools for other language, not found a powerful one for delphi. So I have to make one myself.
What I can say about it is it is useful, and I think it is some what complete. Limited to docs which I actually see them as source codes this tool can make almost any trick. like define a varable, switches, loops, leave alone simple tag relacements.
There need be a ini file which have the tag Values defined, or there could be a function to deal them more flexibly.
But still some more feature could be added to it, like send a long text from doc to source, not just a simple tag.
